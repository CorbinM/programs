#How to compile programs in Terminal
In case ya didn't know:

   $ g++ -std=c++11 * -o runProgram
   
   //compiles all of the files and creates the execuatable "runProgram" in the same directory\n
   
   $ ./runProgram\n
   
   //you HAVE to type the "./" before the program. It's a weird thing about linux.\n
